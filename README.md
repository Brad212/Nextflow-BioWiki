# TKI-Nextflow-wiki
This repository is a compilation of the documentation associated with the "Theme Collaboration Award" (2023) from Telethon Kids Institute.

<!-- Scope: -->
This Biowiki page is intended to be a one-stop solution for getting started with Nextflow and running the nf-core pipelines for the Telethon Kids Institute infrastructure. The Biowiki documents the customisation and debugging of these pipelines within the TKI-infrastructure, and provides the relevant external resources. Including seminar summaries, a FAQ page is available, as well as tip pages which provide resources for those moving forward in their journey of pipeline utilisation, creation, and troubleshooting.
