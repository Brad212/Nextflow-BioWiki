## Basecamp

1. Text editor micro:
Text editors: A program used to edit plain text files, create and edit files based in various programming languages, handle “hand-coding”
of many different languages [reference](https://learntocodewith.me/resources/text-editors/).

Text editor: computer program enabling users to
create, change, edit, open and view plain text files, function now is to draft
and operate complex code (https://online.york.ac.uk/tech-basics-an-introduction-to-text-editors/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20text%20editor,documents%20to%20crafting%20complex%20code.)

# Add the code for how to download
What is micro? Terminal based text editor (https://micro-editor.github.io/), no
dependencies, easy to use and intuitive
Smart and intuitive terminal orientated text
editor, used for editing SSH files and other terminal tasks (https://linuxhint.com/install-micro-text-editor-linux/)

Built in help pages (Ctrl-E + help topic OR Ctrl-G),
also help pages built into GitHub repository (https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)

Able to be used in a modern terminal (MacOS, Windows,
Linux, etc.)
Similar keybindings/shortcuts compared to
Microsoft word (save, copy, paste, undo)
Similar to the text editor nano
Install using prebuilt binary, quick-install
script, eget, package managers (brew - Mac, snap – Linux, as well as many other
package managers - https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)
## add the code parts/practical tutorial resources
at the end, closer to the bin creation and path navigation
# add the code for opening/running micro (no
more tutorial related content, can use the linked GitHub or the specified help
pages)
Shell and PATHS
## purely adding the coding blocks
Link this portion to the movement of micro
installed to the bin directory (directory where user of operating system can
find their applications, contains shells like bash and commonly used comands - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/237152/purpose-of-bin-directory#:~:text=Bin%20is%20an%20abbreviation%20of,aren't%20used%20to%20them.
