## Customising Configurations

### Contents:
- Using custom containers for different steps of the pipeline
- Increasing resources for some processes
- Changing arguments for different modules
    - Reducing parallelism for controlled experiments
    - Max cpu/time/memory of the pipeline and processes
- Pipeline to be optimized  [`nfcore/methylseq`](https://nf-co.re/methylseq)
